    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section id="about">
        <p>Hello, I'm Marcus Olsson, a 27 years old, originally from Värmland and now living in Växjö, I am pursuing a degree in Systemvetenskap at Linnéuniversitetet.
            Before i started my studies, I gained valuable work experience in sales and customer support, working for companies like Telenor and Telia,
            where I handled customer inquiries related to subscription cancellations. I've also worked in a sports store, managing the shoe section.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the course of my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in information systems, system development, and IT security,
            thanks to a diverse curriculum that spans topics such as organizational systems, business process modeling, object-oriented programming, and IT security.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my first year, I acquired essential skills in business modeling, database management, and data analytics,
            while deepening my programming knowledge in both foundational and object-oriented techniques. As I entered my second year,
            I expanded my expertise into more advanced topics such as problem structuring, project methodology, and quality assurance in information systems.
            I also gained hands-on experience developing web-based applications and refining my understanding of scientific methods in the context of informatics research.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion lies in system design and system development, with a keen focus on the role of a business analyst. Additionally,
            I am deeply interested in information and cybersecurity, aspiring to build a career in either of these areas upon completing my studies.
            With a holistic understanding of IT systems and their intersection with business, I look forward to contributing to innovative and secure digital solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <h3>Group Project Lego Database</h3>
        <p>
            Description:
            Each group receives a case where, according to the description and wishes that appear, you must design and create a database.
            Along with each case description also comes a number of questions such as the database you design and create should be able to respond.
            2 of 5 The project is divided into three different phases: (1) The conceptual phase, (2) the logical phase, and (3) implementation phase.
            After all groups have been approved in the first and second phases (conceptual and logical modeling) work on implementation (phase 3).
            The content and requirements for the different phases are described in what follows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase 1 - Conceptual modeling Requirements:
            - A complete ER model according to the problem descriptions, interviews and other collected data you have.
            - You can use any program to develop the model. However, ensure that your ER chart is readable when you include it in the report.
            - The report shall include an overall description of the ER model, which also describes abbreviations and complex relationships. Phase 1 documentation may be a maximum of 1.5
            – 2 pages in the report.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase 2 - Logical modeling Requirements:
            - A complete mapping of the graphical ER model to a relationship model implementation model. The implementation model should be text-based in this mode.
            - Normalization of the implementation model according to all the normalization rules from the theory and which you well document in the accompanying interim report.
            - A shorter text where you explain the mapping and what you have done and how you thought when normalizing your relationship model.
            - For each table, show sample data for an entry.
            - Phase 2 documentation may be a maximum of 3 – 4 pages in the report.
            - Phase 1 and phase 2 must be approved by your supervisor and it must include any additions. This is a prerequisite for being able to move on to phase 3.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phase 3 - Implementation Requirements:
            - Implementation of the database according to implementation model and normalization.
            - Removes the graphical presentation of the database you have created and insert in the interim report.
            - Record relevant data / information in the database. Minimum 8 – 10 occurrences per base table, and minimum 10 – 15 occurrences in ”coupling tables ”.
            - Answer the case-specific questions. The SQL syntax and the result must be reported.
            - Answer five relevant questions for the database you created. You report all questions with both the issue in text, the SQL syntax and the result.
        </p>

    <section id="projectTwo">
        <h2>Project 2</h2>
        <h3>Data Analytics Project</h3>
        <p>
            Description:
            Descriptive analysis techniques in Tableau will be used to visualize and explore the data, identifying
            patterns and trends in the data and visualizing the relationships between different variables.
            And design and create a dashboard in Tableau to understand the factors that contribute to understanding of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Requirements:
            - The absolute and relative frequencies and respective cumulative frequencies for an attribute in the dataset.
            - Draw various charts and graphs including histogram, boxplot, scatterplot, etc.
            - Calculate the location (mean, median, mode) and the dispersion statistics for two attributes in the dataset.
            - Be designed to work for different displays and devices (desktop, mobile phone, tablet).
            - Provide the appropriate visualization type for your data and customize the formatting and layout to make it easy to read and interpret.
            - Have filters to focus on specific segments of your data and to control what data is displayed in your visualizations.
            - Have annotations that provide context to your visualizations by adding text, arrows, or images to highlight key insights or trends in your data.
            - Provide interactive elements such as buttons, sliders, and drop-down menus.

        <h2>Project 3</h2>
        <h3>Group project design and code a Library lending system</h3>
        <p>
            Description
            The project task is to develop a system and perform unit testing for your core methods for this
            system by using the Mockito framework with the JUnit 5 extension model to control the input of the
            tests, verify the behavior, keep track of the development with Git, and finally capture and
            store/analyze some of the logging activities with Log4j 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Requirements for the system:
            Core methods must be unit tested
            – JUnit
            – Mockito
            Use logging for capturing events/behaviour
            – Log4j2
            Save information on a secondary storage!
            – File
            – Database
            User interface
            Keep it as simple as possible
            Console application will do
        </p>
        <p>
            - Lend Item:
            - If it does not exist then the member is notified (i.e., you should print a message to the librarian who uses the system).
            - If the library title is found, then the librarian checks if there is an available item for borrowing and in case there is not an available item you notify the librarian (i.e., you should
                print a message to the librarian who uses the system).
            - If there is an available item, then the item is given to the member, and the system updates the number of the member’s borrowed items appropriately and the available items of this
                title.
        </p>
        <p>
            Return Item:
            For instance, a member of the library returns a library item. The librarian checks the
            person’s ID and then returns the book. The system should properly refresh the number of borrowed
            items for this member and the available items of the title.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subscribe/Register:
            - If the personal number was already registered, but the person had violated the regulation, then a notice is informing the librarian that the registration is not allowed and the process
                ends without registration.
            - If the personal number was already registered and he/she has not violated the regulations, then nothing happens (i.e., a message is printed to the librarian that everything is already alright).
            - If the personal number was not in the database, the candidate member’s information (first name, last name, personal number) is registered, and the member gets a suitable unique ID.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unsubscribe/Delete:
            - The member might request for his/her deletion. The application is checked against the correctness of its elements (if he/she is a member).
            However, if it is a case of deletion due to violations of the regulation, no application is required. When an account is deleted, the member code is "released" for future use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suspend:
            - The librarian checks a member's borrowed items based on his/her ID. If he/she has delayed returning library items more than two times (i.e., initialize an integer counter),
            the registration is suspended for 15 days, and the member becomes inactive for that time. That means each member must return their borrowed books at the worst case after 15 days. If not,
            then the previously described integer counter should be +1.
        </p>
